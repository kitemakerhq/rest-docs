  This site describes the REST API available in Kitemaker. This allows you to interact with work items etc as an alternative, though not as fully fledged as the GraphQL developer API.

  For questions or comments, please reach out at [hi@kitemaker.co](mailto:hi@kitemaker.co) or leave us an issue in the [repository](https://github.com/kitemakerhq/rest-docs) of this documentation.
